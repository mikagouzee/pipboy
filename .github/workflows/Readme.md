Due to architectural issues, this is in stand-by.

The screen I'm currently using on the Pi is quite old, and not supported by most current drivers, meaning it's incompatible with Chromium. I started a workaround by using two scripts to capture inputs and forward them; as well as screenshotting the GUI and displaying that on the touchscreen, but it's messy and absolutely non-efficient.

I will start this project over with Avalonia, and come back later on this version to use it as an "overseer terminal" that allows me to push quests/info to the "dweller" pip-boy.

Things learned or reviewed in this project however : 
--Bases of React and Context
--Ansible 
--Services on the Pi
--Github Actions
